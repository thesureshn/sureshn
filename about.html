	    <h2>Research Areas</h2>
	    <p>My research work spans multiple areas in Artificial Intelligence, with a primary focus on Video Quality Assessment and its applications in modern video processing systems. Below are the key areas of my research:</p>
	    
	    <ul>
		<li>
		    <strong>No-reference Video Quality Assessment (VQA) using Deep Learning:</strong>
		    Developing advanced machine learning models to evaluate video quality without requiring a reference video, enabling real-time assessments for streaming platforms and other video processing applications.
		</li>
		<li>
		    <strong>Video Processing, Compression, and Streaming:</strong>
		    Working on algorithms to optimize video encoding, compression, and streaming, improving efficiency and quality for real-world applications such as video conferencing and OTT platforms.
		</li>
		<li>
		    <strong>Computer Vision and Image Analysis:</strong>
		    Enabling machines to interpret and analyze visual data for tasks like object detection, image classification, and scene understanding.
		</li>
		<li>
		    <strong>Deep Learning for Action Recognition and Temporal Features:</strong>
		    Leveraging temporal dynamics in videos to identify actions, events, and patterns, which is critical for surveillance, sports analytics, and human activity recognition.
		</li>
		<li>
		    <strong>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Low-resource Languages:</strong>
		    Building OCR systems tailored for languages with limited datasets, enabling digitization and accessibility for underrepresented linguistic communities.
		</li>
		<li>
		    <strong>Representation Learning and Transfer Learning:</strong>
		    Creating generalized feature representations that can be transferred across tasks, reducing the need for extensive data and accelerating model training for novel problems.
		</li>
	    </ul>
